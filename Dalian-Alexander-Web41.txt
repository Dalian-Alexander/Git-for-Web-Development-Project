Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        block elements always start on a new line, takes up the full width available, and has a top and bottom margin.
        inline elements does not start on a new line, and only takes up as much width as necessary.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        an element that is absolutely positioned will position itself relative to the nearest position ancestor anchoring to it where ever the ancestor is moved
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        disply block elements: <header> <footer> <p>
        display inline elements: <span> <a>
        display inline block element: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        all elements have a box around them consisting of multiple areas, the outter most area being the margin, then the border, then the padding, then the content being the innermost.
        and i believe you can "fix" them but using rem values instead of px. because rem values are relative to everything on the page the viewer is using.
